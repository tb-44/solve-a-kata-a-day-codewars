// In this game, which we will call the coins-in-a-line game, an even number, n, of coins, of various denominations from various countries, are placed in a line. Two players, who we will call Alice and Bob, take turns removing one of the coins from either end of the remaining line of coins. That is, when it is a player’s turn, he or she removes the coin at the left or right end of the line of coins and adds that coin to his or her collection. The player who removes a set of coins with larger total value than the other player wins, where we assume that both Alice and Bob know the value of each coin.

// Example:
// coins []  =  { 6, 9, 1, 2, 16, 8}

// trial 1: (players will pick the best option available for them)
// coins [] = { 6, 9, 1, 2, 16, 8} , Alice picks 8
// coins [] = { 6, 9, 1, 2, 16}, Bob picks 16
// coins [] = { 6, 9, 1, 2}, Alice picks 6
// coins [] = { 9, 1, 2}, Bob picks 9
// coins [] = {1, 2}, Alice picks 2
// coins [] = {1}, Bob picks 1
// Alice: 8+6+2 =16 Bob: 16+9+1=26 => Alice Lost

// So clearly picking up the best in each move is not good for Alice. What else Alice can do to win the game.

// trial 2: (Alice thinks about Bob's move, Will discuss the strategy in solution) 
// coins [] = { 6, 9, 1, 2, 16, 8} , Alice picks 6
// coins [] = { 9, 1, 2, 16, 8}, Bob picks 9
// coins [] = { 1, 2, 16, 8}, Alice picks 1
// coins [] = 2, 16, 8}, Bob picks 8
// coins [] = {2, 16}, Alice picks 16
// coins [] = {2}, Bob picks 2
// Alice: 6+1+16 =23 Bob: 9+8+2=19 => Alice Won

// So this time Alice has won. Let's see the solution and discuss what Alice has done to win the game.
