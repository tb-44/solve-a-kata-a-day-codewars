//A number m of the form 10x + y is divisible by 7 if and only if x âˆ’ 2y is divisible by 7. 
//In other words, subtract twice the last digit from the number formed by the remaining digits. 
//Continue to do this until a number known to be divisible or not by 7 is obtained; you can stop 
//when this number has at most 2 digits because you are supposed to know if a number of 
//at most 2 digits is divisible by 7 or not.

//solution
